:h1 Cookie Parser

It is painsome to add a long list of cookies by copy/paste every field. The cookie parser can parse a block of exported cookie data from an browser. At the moment Firefox2/3 and Internet Explorer are supported. 

:h2 Firefox 2

In your firefox profile directory copy/paste the cookies into the data field.

An entry should be formatted like this:
:div code
.example.com	TRUE	/	FALSE	1210456801	session-id	000-0000000-0000000
:/div

:h2 Firefox 3

Firefox 3 saves the cookie in sqlite databases. 

Here is an explanation how to export them under *nix:~~
Execute the following command in your profile directory to export the cookies:

:div code
sqlite3 -separator $'\t' cookies.sqlite "select name,value,host,path from moz_cookies" > cookie_export.txt
:/div

Copy/Paste the result from cookie_export.txt into the parser field. (Be careful to preseve the tabs between the fields)

An entry should be formatted like this:
:div code
session-id	000-0000000-0000000	.example.com	/
:/div


:h2 Internet Explorer

Copy the data from your user@host.domain[n].txt file and paste it into the data field.
Do not use the windows notepad, it removes the CR's which are needed to separate the fields.

An entry should be formatted like this:
:div code
session-id~~
000-0000000-0000000~~
.example.com/~~
1024~~
342532096~~
